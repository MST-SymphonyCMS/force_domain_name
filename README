Real simple extension to Symphony CMS

1- Just unzip and put in extension dir
2- Name the folder ***force_domain_name***
3- Enable just like any other ext
4- Go into the settings to set the domain name you wanna use

Voila !


--- Special thanks to robphilp: I made my extension based on the code he wrote for the Symphony 2 Url 
Router. I put comments in my code in order to remember why rob did it like he did. ---
